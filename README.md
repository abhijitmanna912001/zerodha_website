# Zerodha Website

## Step 1: Learning HTML Tags

As we begin building the Zerodha website, our first step is to familiarize ourselves with some essential HTML tags. Below is a list of the tags we will be using:

### HTML Tags

- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<title>`
- `<body>`
- `<div>` / `<span>`
- `<h1> ... <h6>`
- `<p>`
- `<img>`
- `<a>`
- `<input>`
- `<button>`
- `<b>` | `<i>`
- `<center>`

Understanding these tags will help us structure the content of our website effectively. Each tag has a specific purpose and will be used to build a well-organized HTML document.
