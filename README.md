# Zerodha Website

## Step 1: Learning HTML Tags

As we begin building the Zerodha website, our first step is to familiarize ourselves with some essential HTML tags. Below is a list of the tags we will be using:

### HTML Tags

- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<title>`
- `<body>`
- `<div>` / `<span>`
- `<h1> ... <h6>`
- `<p>`
- `<img>`
- `<a>`
- `<input>`
- `<button>`
- `<b>` | `<i>`
- `<center>`

Understanding these tags will help us structure the content of our website effectively. Each tag has a specific purpose and will be used to build a well-organized HTML document.

## Step 2: Learning HTML Attributes

In addition to the tags, we will also learn about some common HTML attributes. Below are examples of tags with their respective attributes:

### HTML Attributes

- `<img src="a.png">`
- `<a href="https://www.google.com">`
- `<button onclick="functionName()">`
- `<input id="username">`

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and help in defining their behavior and appearance.

## Step 3: Adding CSS

To enhance the visual appearance of our Zerodha website, we will learn to add CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to our page. Below are some common CSS properties we will study and use:
